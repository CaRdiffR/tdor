#' Transgender Day of Remembrance Data
#'
#' This data set contains information on killings and suicides of transgender
#' people, collected for the Transgender Day of Remembrance.
#'
#' The Transgender Day of Remembrance (TDoR) is held annually on November 20.
#' On this day, people memorialise those who have been murdered or lost to
#' suicide as a result of transphobia in the previous year.
#'
#' The `TDoR` variable notes the particular TDoR that a record relates to. The
#' first TDoR was held in 1999, so `TDoR` is missing before 1998-11-19. Until
#' TDoR 2010, each TDoR memorialised deaths that had occurred since the last
#' TDoR. From 2009, the Trans Murder Monitoring project from
#' Transgender Europe (TGEU) began to release annual updates of relevant deaths.
#' During the years #' 2011 to 2013 the period these updates covered shifted
#' earlier in the year, to allow time for records to be checked and for
#' the reports to be made in time for the day of remembrance itself.
#' In these years the periods were
#' \describe{
#'     \item{2011}{November 20 2010 to November 14 2011.}
#'     \item{2012}{November 15 2011 to November 14 2012.}
#'     \item{2013}{November 20 2012 to November 1 2013.}
#' }
#' From 2014 onwards the period has been from October 1 to September 30. To
#' avoid ambiguity and allow newly discovered records to be added, the `TDoR`
#' variable closes the gap between 2012 and 2013, setting the end date to
#' November 19, and assign deaths from October 1 2013 to November 1 2013 to
#' TDoR 2014.
